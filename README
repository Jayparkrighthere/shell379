Acknowledgement:
    knowledge of signal, pip, popen,exit from   
        Lab 2,3 codes
    knowledge of sigchld handler is from:

Note:
    Runnig jobs command will show a process table:
        1. Status can be T+, S+, or R+. 
            T+ : process is stopped(suspended)
            R+ : process is running
            S+ : process is sleeping.
        2. Process in S+ or R+ state is considered as active process
        3. running command: suspend <pid> will stop a process and turn the status from
            R+ to T+
        4. running command: resume <pid> will resume a process and turn the status from
            T+ to R+
Assumption:
    1.Operators <,>,& will not be used with the
    following command:
        exit
        jobs
        kill <pid>
        resume <pid>
        sleep <int>
        suspend <pid>
        wait <pid>
    2.process status table can not hold more than 32 entries
        if exceed, process will not be added to the table, and
        can not run in background anymore.
